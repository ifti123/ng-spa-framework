# Spa2

This project is based on the Pluralsight course: Building a Responsive SPA Framework with Angular.

Most of this course was completed with Sutton's angular project: sscrm

A big difference in this version is the use of bootstrap@4.0.0-alpha.6 (instead of v 3.7)

##TODO
- Create npm package for the SPA Framework (see Pluralsight - NPM Playbook by Joe Eames)
