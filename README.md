# Building a Responsive SPA Framework with Angular

This project is based on the awesome Pluralsight course: Building a Responsive SPA Framework with Angular by Mark Zamoyta.  All credit should go to Mark Zamoyta for this outside of a few minor changes.

## Angular 4 with Bootstrap 4 and Font-Awesome
The biggest divergents in this project from Mark's is that I used Angular 4.3.2 (instead of Angular 2) with Bootstrap 4 (alpha 6) and Font-Awesome icons (instead of Bootstrap v 3.7 with Glyphicions) to follow along as best I could.  Subtle changes were necessary here and there.

A big difference in this version is the use of bootstrap@4.0.0-alpha.6 (instead of v 3.7).
Since Bootstrap 4 drops glyphicons, font-awesome icons are used.

##TODO
- Create npm package for the SPA Framework (see Pluralsight - NPM Playbook by Joe Eames)
